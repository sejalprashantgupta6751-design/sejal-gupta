## From Objects to Ornament: My Journey with Jewellery Design

My interest in jewellery design emerged organically—through material exploration, attention to detail, and a deeper curiosity about **scale, intimacy, and craft**. Coming from a background in **product, furniture, and lifestyle design**, jewellery became a natural extension of my design thinking, where precision meets emotion.

Unlike large-scale objects or spaces, jewellery demands a heightened sensitivity. Every curve, joint, and finish matters. This shift in scale marked an important turning point in how I approach design.

### Why Jewellery Interested Me

Jewellery, for me, is not just about adornment—it is about **storytelling at a personal scale**. It sits close to the body, carries emotional value, and often reflects identity, memory, and culture.

What drew me in was:

- The **intimacy of scale** and interaction
- Deep focus on **materials, finishes, and tactility**
- The balance between **aesthetic expression and wearability**
- The opportunity to explore **craft-driven design**

My experience working with materials—metal, form, surface, and light—helped me transition seamlessly into this domain.

### My Work at Rudrali

Working at **Rudrali** played a significant role in shaping my understanding of jewellery as a discipline. It introduced me to a more **refined, process-oriented approach**, where concept, craft, and execution are deeply interconnected.

At Rudrali, I was involved in:

- Supporting **design development and concept translation**
- Exploring **forms, proportions, and surface details**
- Understanding the importance of **craftsmanship and finishing**
- Observing how design decisions directly impact **wearability and user experience**

This experience strengthened my appreciation for the **discipline and patience** required in jewellery design and reinforced the importance of respecting both material and maker.

### A Turning Point in My Design Thinking

Jewellery shifted my mindset as a designer. It trained me to:

- Think **micro before macro**
- Design with **precision and restraint**
- Value **process as much as outcome**
- Pay attention to how an object feels, not just how it looks

This learning now informs all my work—whether I am designing spaces, furniture, or visual concepts for brands.

### Looking Forward

My journey with jewellery design is still evolving. I see it as a space where **craft, contemporary design, and personal expression** intersect. Moving forward, I want to continue exploring jewellery alongside spatial and lifestyle design—allowing each discipline to inform and enrich the other.

This blog will document my evolving relationship with jewellery, materials, and making—capturing learnings, experiments, and reflections along the way.
