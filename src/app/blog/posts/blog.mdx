## Working at the Intersection of Brand, Space & Story

I currently work with a design agency as an **Assistant Manager**, where my role sits at the intersection of **brand identity, spatial visualization, and visual merchandising (VM)**. My day-to-day work involves helping clients **visualize their retail spaces better**, translating brand language into physical environments, and communicating ideas clearly through **presentations, moodboards, and concept decks**.

### What I Do

My core responsibility is to support brands in shaping how their stores _feel_ before they are built. This includes:

- Creating **visual narratives** for retail spaces
- Developing **moodboards and concept presentations**
- Assisting with **VM strategies and spatial storytelling**
- Working closely with clients to align **brand identity with design direction**

With a strong background in **product, furniture, and lifestyle design**, I bring a material-driven and detail-oriented approach to every project. My strengths lie in **aesthetics, lighting understanding, and realistic visualization**, which help clients imagine the final outcome with clarity and confidence.

### Brands I’m Working With (Currently in Process)

I am currently collaborating on projects across fashion, footwear, and lifestyle brands. All projects are ongoing, and each brand is at a different stage of development.

#### Mirragio

A contemporary accessories brand focused on creating a refined yet approachable retail experience that aligns with its modern design language.

#### Nike

Working within a high-energy, performance-driven brand ecosystem that demands clarity, precision, and strong visual hierarchy in spatial storytelling.

#### White Crow

A fashion-forward brand where experimentation, mood, and identity play a key role in shaping the in-store experience.

While the details of these projects are still evolving, the common thread across all of them is a strong emphasis on **brand-led design and thoughtful visualization**.

### How I Work

I collaborate with **talented designers, strategists, and clients** in a fast-paced yet supportive environment. Being surrounded by **great people and a strong company culture** has allowed me to sharpen my skills, understand real-world constraints, and grow as a designer who can balance creativity with practicality.

My approach is:

- **Concept-first, detail-focused**
- Rooted in **strong aesthetics and storytelling**
- Backed by clear communication and presentation

### Looking Ahead

This role has strengthened my ability to think beyond objects and focus on **experiences**—how people move through a space, interact with products, and emotionally connect with a brand. As I continue to grow, I aim to work on projects that blend **design, craft, material exploration, and spatial narratives** in meaningful ways.

This blog will gradually document my process, learnings, and reflections as I continue working with brands, spaces, and ideas in motion.
